/**
 * Sending a file was implemented in `outbound.sendMedia` from the start, but
 * the channel never told core it could do it: `describeMessageTool` listed
 * every action except `upload-file`. That does not fail loudly — it fails as a
 * shrug. On 2026-08-07 the owner asked the agent to draw a cat; the image was
 * generated, resized and waiting on disk, and the agent — with no action able
 * to carry a file — answered "Вот кот 🐱" in plain text. The file never moved.
 *
 * These tests tie the advertised action to the implementation in both
 * directions, the same way the reaction tests do, so the pair cannot drift.
