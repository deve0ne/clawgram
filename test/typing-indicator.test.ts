/**
 * The typing indicator is a promise that words are coming, so it is owed only
 * to someone who addressed the agent.
 *
 * Under `groupPolicy: "open"` every message starts a turn and most of those
 * turns end in silence. On 2026-08-17 the owner's management chat watched
 * «Тина печатает…» for 20–26 seconds on four consecutive messages that were
 * never addressed to her, each followed by nothing — the indicator was the
 * only thing the room saw of a decision to stay quiet.
 *
 * The read receipt is a separate fact and survives: she did read it.
